# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Python

This repository provides a collection of code implementations for various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Python. The project is designed as a resource for developers and students who are looking to understand or revise the core concepts of DSA through practical code examples.

## Contents
* Sorting Algorithms: Implementations of quick sort, merge sort, bubble sort, and more.
* Searching Algorithms: Binary search, linear search, and other search techniques.
* Graph Algorithms: Depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), Dijkstra's algorithm, etc.
* Dynamic Programming: Solutions to classic problems using dynamic programming techniques.
* Greedy Algorithms: Various algorithms that follow the greedy approach.
* Other Data Structures: Code for implementing arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs, and more.
